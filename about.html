        <h2><u>Overview</u></h2>
        <p>
            I am a nineteen year old fun loving young adult with a passion  for technology, acting, poetry
            and a good debate! I am an avid fan of politics and like to stay up to date with world affairs.
            I am a self-taught Python programmer and have been coding with the language since I was about
            fourteen. I would consider myself to be of intermediate skill with the language. I am also
            familiar JavaScript, NodeJS, HTML, CSS and Java.
        </p>
