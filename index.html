            Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Rory Williams Doyle and I am a first
            year CPSSD student at Dublin City University. As a highly motivated and eager
            student, I have created this website to aid you in getting to know me better,
            before you decide if I am the right fit for your company. I hope that this site
            will convince you that I am!
        </p>
        <p>
            With an excellent work ethic and strong interpersonal skills, I can work well as
            part of a team and on my own initiative. For instance, as part of my degree this year
            I had to work on a team which was tasked with developing an online voting system. While
            the overall project quality came down to how well we worked together and communicated
            our ideas to each other, there was still a lot of room for individual growth. I maintained
            a leadership role for part of the project and got my first real experience at web development.
            I learned technologies like React, Redux, JavaScript, Loopback and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            This ability to adapt to any role I am placed in, and pick up new technologies on the fly,
            means that I am a highly flexible worker. I am capable of going above and beyond my specified
            duties for the further betterment of my work and to help out my colleagues.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would like to now thank you for showing an interest in me! I greatly appreciate
            the time it has taken you to read this far, and I implore you, if you think that I
            sound like the type of person your looking for, please feel free to read the other
            sections of this site for more in depth detail into my background. You can reach these
            other sections using the cluster of buttons in the top right hand side of the navigation
            bar above.
        </p>
        <p>
            And too all of you who have not been sold thus far on my candidacy for your employ,
            I would greatly appreciate your feedback! Please feel free to send me a short message
            outlining your thoughts via the contact form. It can be found in the contact section of
            this site.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for your consideration,<br/>
            Rory Williams Doyle.
