            Hello! My name is Rory Williams Doyle and I am a first year CPSSD student at Dublin City University.
            I have created this website to aid you in getting to know me and my technical skill set better. Hopefully,
            after seeing what my skills can bring to your company, you will reach out and give me an opportunity to
            demonstrate my abilities in person.

        <h1><u>Experience</u></h1>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3><u>UniShop (Sep 2017 - Apr 2018)</u></h3>
        <p>
            For my second year college project I am working with a team of three others to create an online e-commerce platform we call UniShop.
            My role in this project is focused on backend development. I created the database schema which we use to store our website data.
            I am the sole person responsible for the development of our REST API. I use NodeJS for the development of the backend and I use the Mocha testing framework for unit testing.
            I am also responsible for the smooth running of our project on a AWS server and have also held the role of scrum master in our project, as we use agile development in our work.
            Our sprints last 3 weeks and are intense, but I have loved every moment working on this project.
        </p>
        <h3><u>offTheChain (Jan 2017 - May 2017)</u></h3>
        <p>
            As part of the first year of my degree programme, I and a team of four had to design and create a project
            of our own choosing. Our team decided to implement an online e-voting system that utilised blockchain
            technology to verify each vote in a public and de-centralized fashion. The project was mostly written in
            JavaScript and also used NodeJS, React, Redux and MongoDB as other supporting technologies. The project was
            a success overall, achieving our specified target by the end date provided by our lecturers. While some more
            time to polish our features would have been nice we learned a lot from working on this project. I learned
            JavaScript and a lot about web design. This has since inspired me to take on a personal project of my own
            in designing a website.
        </p>
        <h3><u>Twitter_Bot (Dec 2016 - Apr 2017)</u></h3>
        <p>
            The Twitter_Bot project is a small open source project that I started during December 2016.
            The idea behind the project came from an assignment I had to submit as part of a team for college.
            However, after much deliberation, I decided to create my own version of the project from scratch.
            This piece of software is capable of managing a Twitter account automatically once it is given the
            right permissions. The benefit of this for a potential user of the software is that you are able to run
            and manage a public twitter page without any human overhead. It was a lot of fun to make and it really
            helped expand my knowledge of working with API's.
        </p>
        <h2>Volunteer Work</h2>
        <h3><u>CoderDojo (Nov 2016 - January 2018)</u></h3>
        <p>
            My work at CoderDojo involved teaching kids, from between the ages 6 to 16, how to write software.
            When starting out, my role primarily involved teaching kids the basics of Scratch, the drag and drop programming language.
            However, for some of the more advanced students, I branched out and taught them the basics of Python, which is my programming language of choice.
