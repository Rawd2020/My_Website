            Hello! My name is Rory Williams Doyle and I am a first year CPSSD student at Dublin City University.
            I have created this website to aid you in getting to know me and my technical skill set better. Hopefully,
            after seeing what my skills can bring to your company, you will reach out and give me an opportunity to
            demonstrate my abilities in person.

        <h1><u>Experience</u></h1>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3><u>offTheChain (Jan 2017 - May 2017)</u></h3>
        <p>
            As part of the first year of my degree programme, I and a team of four had to design and create a project
            of our own choosing. Our team decided to implement an online e-voting system that utilised blockchain
            technology to verify each vote in a public and de-centralized fashion. The project was mostly written in
            JavaScript and also used NodeJS, React, Redux and MongoDB as other supporting technologies. The project was
            a success overall, achieving our specified target by the end date provided by our lecturers. While some more
            time to polish our features would have been nice we learned a lot from working on this project. I learned
            JavaScript and a lot about web design. This has since inspired me to take on a personal project of my own
            in designing a website.
        </p>
        <h3><u>Twitter_Bot (Dec 2016 - Apr 2017)</u></h3>
        <p>
            The Twitter_Bot project is a small open source project that I started during December 2016.
            The idea behind the project came from an assignment I had to submit as part of a team for college.
            However, after much deliberation, I decided to create my own version of the project from scratch.
            This piece of software is capable of managing a Twitter account automatically once it is given the
            right permissions. The benefit of this for a potential user of the software is that you are able to run
            and manage a public twitter page without any human overhead. It was a lot of fun to make and it really
            helped expand my knowledge of working with API's.
        </p>
        <h2>Volunteer Work</h2>
        <h3><u>CoderDojo (Nov 2016 - Present)</u></h3>
        <p>
            My work at CoderDojo involves teaching kids, from between the ages 6 to 16, how to write software for the
            computer. When starting out, my role primarily involved teaching kids the basics of Scratch, the drag and
            drop programming language. However, for some of the more advanced students, I have begun to teach them the
            basics of Python, which is my programming language of choice.
