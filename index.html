        <h1><u>Experience</u></h1>
        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <h3><u>Purpledecks (Aug 2018 - Dec 2018)</u></h3>
        <p>
            Worked at Purpledecks ltd. as a software engineer. My work involved using JavaScript and related
            technologies, such as React, Redux, NodeJS & Jest to deliver professional looking front-end software
            solutions to clients.
        </p>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3><u>UniShop (Sep 2017 - Apr 2018)</u></h3>
        <p>
            For my second year project, I worked with a team to create an online e-commerce platform we called UniShop.
            My role on this project was as a backend developer. I created the database schema which we used to store our
            website data. I was the sole person responsible for the development of our REST API. I used NodeJS for the
            development of the API and I used the Mocha testing framework for unit testing. I was also responsible for
            the smooth running of our project on a AWS server. We utilised agile development for our work. Our sprints
            lasted 3 weeks and were intense, but I have loved every moment working on this project.
        </p>
        <h3><u>offTheChain (Jan 2017 - May 2017)</u></h3>
        <p>
            As part of the first year of my degree programme, I and a team of four had to design, create and deliver a
            software product of our own choosing using agile development. Our team decided to create an online e-voting
            system that utilised blockchain technology to verify each vote in a public and de-centralized fashion.
            The project used JavaScript, NodeJS, React, Redux and MongoDB as well as other supporting technologies.
            The project was a success, achieving our specified target by the end date provided by our lecturers. I
            learned JavaScript and a lot about web design from this project. This has since inspired me to take on
            designing this website.
        </p>
        <h2>Volunteer Work</h2>
        <h3><u>CoderDojo (Nov 2016 - Present)</u></h3>
        <p>
            My work at CoderDojo involves teaching kids, from between the ages 6 to 16, how to write software.
            When starting out, my role involved teaching kids the basics of Scratch, the drag and drop
            programming language. Then, for some of the more advanced students, I branched out and taught them the
            basics of Python, which is my programming language of choice. I do this using a project based curriculum
            that I created. This curriculum teaches the basics of language syntax, logic, and design through the
            creation of different games. These games are then presented at show and tell at the end of each session.
            This gives the kids a clear goal which they enjoy working towards.
